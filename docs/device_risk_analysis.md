# Health Risk Analysis: Excessive Device Usage

**Scope**: Mobile Devices, Laptops, Tablets.
**Focus**: Physiological and Psychological impacts of prolonged usage.

## 1. Scope of Health Issues
We focus on conditions with established clinical associations.

### Included (High Relevance)
*   **Ocular**: Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS), Dry Eye, Myopia progression.
*   **Musculoskeletal (MSD)**: "Text Neck" (Cervical spine stress), Upper Cross Syndrome, RSI (Thumb/Wrist), Lower Back Pain.
*   **Sleep**: Circadian rhythm disruption (Blue light suppression of melatonin).
*   **Mental Health**: Anxiety, Social isolation, "Doomscrolling" impact.

### Excluded (Low Evidence/Out of Scope)
*   RF Radiation effects (Inconclusive).
*   Sedentary lifestyle generalities (handled by general metabolic risk).

## 2. Risk Factors Breakdown
1.  **Duration**: >4 hours/day typically marks the threshold for symptom onset.
2.  **Posture**: Forward head carriage (>15 degrees) increases cervical spine load by 2-3x.
3.  **Ergonomics**: Screen height relative to eye level; wrist support.
4.  **Lighting**: Contrast glare, ambient lighting vs screen brightness.
5.  **Timing**: Usage within 1-2 hours of sleep onset.

## 3. Evidence-Based Effects & Strength

| Health Issue | Manifestation | Evidence Strength | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Digital Eye Strain** | Dryness, blurring, headaches. | **High** | Reduced blink rate (down by 66%), accommodation stress. |
| **"Text Neck" (MSD)** | Chronic neck pain, nerve impingement. | **High** | Mechanical load: 60° tilt = 60lbs force on spine. |
| **Sleep Disruption** | Delayed onset, reduced REM. | **High** | 460nm Blue light suppresses melatonin secretion. |
| **Tendinopathy** | "Texting Thumb", Carpal Tunnel. | **Moderate** | Repetitive micro-movements, sustained gripping. |
| **Anxiety/Depression**| Mood dysregulation, attention deficits.| **Moderate** | Dopaminergic loops, social comparison, sleep loss mediator. |

## 4. Mitigation Strategies

### For Users
*   **Vision**: "20-20-20 Rule" (Every 20 mins, look 20ft away for 20 secs).
*   **Ergonomics**: Raise screens to eye level. Use external keyboards for laptops.
*   **Sleep**: "Digital Sunset" (No devices 60 mins before bed).
*   **Posture**: "Tech Neck" stretches (Chin tucks, chest openers).

### For Employers
*   Mandatory micro-break software.
*   Subsidized ergonomic equipment (Monitor risers).

### For Manufacturers
*   Native "Night Shift" modes enabled by default.
*   Usage time alerts ("Nudge" mechanics).

## 5. Assessment Framework (Self-Score)

**Scoring**: Sum the points.
*   **0-3**: Low Risk
*   **4-7**: Moderate Risk
*   **8+**: High Risk

| Category | Question | Points (Yes=1) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Usage** | Do you use devices >6 hours/day (total)? | 1 |
| **Usage** | Do you use devices within 30 mins of sleep? | 2 |
| **Vision** | Do you experience blurry vision/headaches daily? | 2 |
| **Posture** | Do you look *down* at your phone/laptop >50% of time? | 1 |
| **Posture** | Do you have constant neck/shoulder stiffness? | 2 |
| **Ergo** | Do you use a laptop without a riser/external keyboard? | 1 |
| **Mental** | Do you feel anxious when separated from your phone? | 1 |

### Summary
*   **Low Risk**: Maintain habits.
*   **Moderate**: Implement 20-20-20 rule and basic ergonomics.
*   **High**: Urgent need for "Digital Detox" and ergonomic overhaul. Consult PT/Optometrist if symptoms persist.
